# Logseq DDD

This repository contains a [Logseq](https://logseq.com/) vault dedicated to documenting the domain of a veterinary clinic, with a special focus on the ubiquitous language used within this domain. The vault aims to showcase how Logseq can be an effective tool for domain-driven design (DDD) documentation, enabling the capture and organization of complex domain knowledge in an accessible and navigable format.

### Features

- **Entities and Value Objects**: Detailed descriptions of the domain's entities and value objects, capturing their attributes and behaviors.
- **Aggregate Roots**: Documentation on the aggregate roots that ensure the integrity of the domain model.
- **Repositories**: Overview of repository patterns used for persisting and retrieving domain objects.
- **Domain Events**: Explanation of significant events within the domain and their impact on the model.
- **Ubiquitous Language**: A glossary of terms and language that are universally understood across the domain.
- **Templates**: Useful to create more of the above, following a uniform format
